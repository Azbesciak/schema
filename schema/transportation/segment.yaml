            If turns is omitted, the default turning options for a lane
            are assumed. The default turning options depend on the lane
            location. The leftmost lane for a given travel direction has
            [left, through] by default. A rightmost lane has [right,
            through] by default. Evidently if there is a single lane for
            a given direction, it is both leftmost and rightmost and
            consequently has [left, through, right]. A middle lane has
            [through] by default.

      "$comment": >-
        The lane divider concept models ability to change lanes from a
        navigation standpoint (equivalent to OSM "change" tags) and
        from a visual standpoint (equivalent to OSM "divider" tags)
        because abstract values such as "mayChange" can be mapped to the
        appropriate line markings. Judging by fact that OSM has orders
        of magnitude more "change" tags, the navigation function is
        thought to be more important.

            Because lane ordering follows the physical layout of the
            road, there is no default flow rule, since even a simple
            bidirectional setup with two lanes would only be applicable
            to the part of the world which shares the same driving
            direction.

            A possible alternative would be to make the default a
            one-way flow with a single lane in the forward direction,
            but given how few roads on the planet it would match, this
            choice would reveal a very poor understanding of "default".

            It may be that the "flows" concept is general enough to lift
            up out of "road" and put at the top level. We would have to
            be convinced that it also applies to water/ferry and rail,
            however.
