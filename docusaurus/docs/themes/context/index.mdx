# Context Theme

Features from OpenStreetMap that provide additional context such as **land** and **water** that let users render a more complete basemap.

## Key Schema Design Choices

1. Basic classificaiton of features: type, class, and subclass where appropriate.
2. Parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
4. Extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as wikidata to top-level properties.
3. Direct pass-thru of remaining relevant OSM tags.

## Current Types:

- [placename](/reference/context/placename)
- [land](/reference/context/landuse)
- [landuse](/reference/context/landuse)
- [water](/reference/context/water)
