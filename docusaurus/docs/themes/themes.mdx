# Themes

Themes are top-level categories of map features. A theme may have
multiple _types_ of features, for example the Transportation theme has both `segments` and `connectors`.

## Core Concepts

#### Internal Consistentency
Where applicable, fields such as "address" or "name" will always use the same schema across all themes.

#### Extensible attributes
Any additional _top-level_ property prefixed with `ext` may be added to a feature.
