# Schema Themes

Themes are top-level categories of map features. A theme may have
multiple _types_ of features, for example, the Transportation theme has both `segments` and `connectors`.

## Core Concepts

### Internal Consistency
Where applicable, fields such as "address" or "name" will always use the same schema across all themes.

### Extensible attributes
Any additional _top-level_ property prefixed with `ext` may be added to a feature.

### Stable IDs
The [Global Entity Reference System](/gers) is responsible for handling persistent identification across entities on the map.

**Note**: The <code>id</code> present in examples in this documentation is not demonstrative of the final format of the GERS ID.
