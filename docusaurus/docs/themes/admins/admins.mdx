# Administrative Boundaries

Overture Administrative Boundary (Admins) data includes features and that describe named localities around the world including settlements, cities, regions, provinces in the real world.

## Key Schema Design Choices

### Clear Country Definitions

Overture provides country definitions without gaps or overlaps even in cases of disputes in order to support visualization, sectioning, and other map use cases. In the Overture Maps, a country can be easily found as they can all be found on Admin Level 2. Additionally all countries have been assigned an ISO3166-1 ISO country code which has been kept as possible to the standard. For some disputed areas and remote overseas territories custom ISO codes have been created which can be easily identified.

### Key Admin Attributes


1. [Locality](/reference/admins/locality) describes a named and typically populated place.
There are two subTypes:
   - Administrative Localities model countries and their hierarchical subdivisions. Each Administrative Locality has an administrative level indicating
their level within a country. Attributes like like driving side and default language have been added to the schema.
   - Named Localities model named places that are not part of a countries administrative hierarchy.

2. [Administrative Boundary](/reference/admins/administrativeBoundary) provides a boundary line of Administrative Localities. This feature allows for an easy display of country borders and
administrative subdivisions within countries. Boundaries shared by different Administrative Localities are represented by one line. A maritime attribute has been added allowing to filter out boundaries located within seas or oceans.
