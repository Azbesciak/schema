# Administrative Boundaries

Overture Administrative Boundary (Admins) data includes features that describe named localities in the real world including settlements, cities, regions, provinces, and countries.

The current version of the schema does not support modeling of disputed bondaries or multiple geo-political views. In future schema versions, we will have support for:

1. Marking a boundary as disputed.
2. Providing multiple views of a country boundary based on the user's region.
3. Modeling the relationship between a country and its overseas territories (e.g., Puerta Rico) and other disputed territories (e.g., West Bank).

## Key Schema Design Choices

### Clear Country Definitions

There are no gaps or overlaps at the country level (<code>adminLevel=2</code>) in order to support visualization, sectioning, and other mapping use cases, even in cases of disputed boundaries.
Additionally, all countries have been assigned an ISO3166-1 ISO country code which has been kept as close as possible to the standard. For some disputed areas and remote overseas territories, custom ISO codes have been created to describe the region which can be easily identified.

### Admin Types

1. [Locality](/reference/admins/locality) describes a named and typically populated place.
There are two subTypes:
   - Administrative Localities model countries and their hierarchical subdivisions. Each Administrative Locality has an administrative level indicating their level within a country. Attributes like like driving side and default language are also available.
   - Named Localities model named places that are not part of a countries administrative hierarchy.

2. [Administrative Boundary](/reference/admins/administrativeBoundary) provides a boundary line of Administrative Localities. This feature allows for an easy display of country borders and
administrative subdivisions within countries. Boundaries shared by different Administrative Localities are represented by one line. A maritime attribute supports filtering on boundaries located within seas or oceans.
