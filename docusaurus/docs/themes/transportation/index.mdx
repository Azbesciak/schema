# Transportation

Overture Transportation data includes features and attributes that describe the infrastructure and conventions of how people and objects move about the world.

## Key Schema Design Choices

### Scoped Properties
Overture supports rule-based properties to apply properties that only apply to sub-segments, certain directions of travel, points-in-time, environmental conditions, etc. Geometric scoping may be used to represent static value properties that are "always there."

### Segmentation and Connector Model
Overture models the transportation network using Segments that embody sections of road/trail/path that have similar properties and Connectors that indicate where, for given modes of transportation, it is possible to transition from one segment to another.


## Scoping Dimensions

### Geometric Scoping: Linear Referencing
- In general the <code>at</code> property MAY contain either a single scalar number, or pair (two-entry array) of numbers.
  - A scalar number means the parent property applies at a discrete position along the segment, while a pair indicates the parent property along the whole sub-segment of the segment from the first position in the pair to the second position in the pair.
  - There is no negated version of the property, i.e. <code>notAt</code>, because this adds significant complexity to geometric scoping, and all use cases could use multiple at properties to instead define where a scoped property does apply.

### Temporal Scoping: Opening Hours

- A single temporal scoping property named <code>during</code> MUST contain a string expressed in the [OSM opening hours specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification).
- The <code>during</code> property, if present, narrows the scope of the parent value to apply only during the time periods specified by the during value.
- There is no negated version of the property, i.e. <code>notDuring</code>, because the phrase "not during X" can be expressed as "during the complement of X" and the OSM opening hours specification can handle all such cases.

### Environmental Scoping

There is a single environmental conditions scoping property named conditions which, if present, must contain a non-empty set of environmental condition values, modeled as an array containing unique items. These conditions include weather-related conditions (e.g. snow or fog), or local signaled conditions (e.g. OSM's flashing_light tag) that indicate some variation on the default properties of the transportation feature.
The conditions property, if present, narrows the scope of the parent value to apply only when the local environment has at least one of the conditions specified in the conditions set

### Subjective Scoping

There are currently five known sub-dimensions of subjective scoping:

1. **Travel mode**. The methods or vehicles allowed or not allowed to use a road or path.
2. **Usage purpose**. The reason a person or entity is traveling on the transportation network. A common example of a usage purpose condition is delivery only or customer only.
3. **Membership** in a recognized group, a.k.a. status.  Membership in a recognized group refers to the status of the person or entity traveling as recognized by authorities controlling the particular location. This includes private property or permitted portions of the transportation network.
4. **Cargo**. Cargo refers to something the person or entity traveling on the transportation network is carrying. The most common example of a cargo scope is portions of the transportation network where transporting hazardous material is not allowed.
5. **Vehicle Attributes**. These refer to specific attributes of vehicles that are too specific to infer from travel mode, or where it is overly cumbersome to generate a travel mode for each attribute combination. This includes scoping vehicles that are allowed based on attributes like height, weight or axle count.
