# Theme

Themes are top-level categories of map features. A theme may have
multiple _types_ of features, for example the Transportation theme has both `segments` and `connectors`.



## Core Concepts

#### Internal Consistentency
Where applicable, fields such as "address" or "name" will always use the same schema across all themes.

#### Extensible attributes
#TODO: Describe this here instead of in each theme

### Current Themes

- [Admins](/themes/admins/)
- [Buildings](/themes/buildings/building)
- [Places](/themes/places/place)
- [Transportation](/themes/transportation/index)
