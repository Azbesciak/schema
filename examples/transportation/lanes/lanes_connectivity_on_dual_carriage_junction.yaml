      # Example shows modelling of lanes on more complex junction between dual carriage roads
      # Even though there are intermediate segments (111 and 222) that are part of junction modeling
      # there is no lane information on them, and they are treated as 'via' elements of maneuvers between
      # segments 123, 234 and 345 - and those maneuvers are clearly following from topology (unless restriction on
      # segments are not restricting them)
      # There is no actual 'via' elements in connectivity modeling because they are clearly inferred from roads
      # topology.
