      # This flow section describes a fairly complex segment in which a
      # physically separate sidewalk and physically separated cycling lane are
      # modeled on the same segment. This segment sharing is not expected to be
      # the norm (we expect sidewalk and cycling lanes to more often have their
      # own distinct segments); but where the data needs to be modeled this
      # way, it can be.
      #
      # There are two flow rules operating within distinct time periods. In
      # the first time period, there are two vehicle lanes travelling in each
      # direction. In the opposite period, there is only one vehicle lane in
      # each direction, presumably because the other lanes have transitioned
      # to parking.
