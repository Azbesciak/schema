        Pattern is used as a fallback because not all JSON schema
        implementations treat "format" as an assertion, for some it is
        only an annotation.
        
        A somewhat more compact approach would be to reference the
        Overture version where the feature last changed instead of the
        update time, and expect clients to do a lookup if they really
        care about the time.

    linearlyReferencedPosition:
      description: >-
        Represents a linearly-referenced position between 0% and 100% of

        center-line segment.
      type: number
      minValue: 0
      maxValue: 1
      "$comment": >-
        One possible advantage to using percentages over absolute
        distances is being able to trivially validate that the position
        lies "on" its segment (i.e. is between zero and one). Of course,
        this level of validity doesn't mean the number isn't nonsense.
    linearlyReferencedRange:
      description:
        Represents a non-empty range of positions along a path as a pair
        linearly-referenced positions. For example, the pair [0.25, 0.5]
        represents the range beginning 25% of the distance from the
        start of the path and ending 50% oof the distance from the path
        start.

      "$comment":
        Ideally we would enforce sorted order of this pair, but sorting
        assertions aren't (yet?) supported by JSON schema.
    openingHours:
      description: >-
        Time span or time spans during which something is open or
        active, specified in the OSM opening hours specification:
          https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification
      type: string
      pattern: ^Mo-Sa 09:00-12:00( closed)?, We 15:00-18:00( closed)?$
      "$comment": >-
          The "pattern" is just a placeholder. We assume we can
          specify a regular expression to give *some* degree of
          initial lexical validation, but higher-level validation
          will have to be done outside of JSON schema.

          Reasons for using the OSM opening hours specification for
          transportation rule time restrictions are documented in
          https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/pull/10
