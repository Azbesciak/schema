# Places Schema

## Schema

The schema is stored in [place.yaml](../schema/places/place.yaml).

The schema is decoupled from the exchange format. The choice of the exchange format will lead to a definition how to express the data according to the customs of the exchange format.

## Open Questions

1. Is the schema defining the output of Overture or an internal exchange format between Overture contributors?
